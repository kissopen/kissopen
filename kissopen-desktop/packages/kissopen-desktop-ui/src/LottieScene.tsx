 *
 * - `alien-monster` — people and agents are together in one live session.
 * - `cherry-blossom` — a new friendship has begun.
 * - `closed-lock` — access is secured.
 * - `cloud-variation` — work runs on hardware that is not this machine.
 * - `confetti-ball` — one milestone has just completed.
 * - `disguised-face` — this machine's identity is being defined.
 * - `front-facing-baby-chick` — a new social identity is ready to meet people.
 * - `hatching-chick` — something new has been created.
 * - `llama` — several models are being combined on one job.
 * - `mirror-ball` — one session, channel, or moment a whole circle is in at once.
 * - `monkey-hear-no-evil` — nobody outside can listen to this.
 * - `open-hands` — a social invitation is waiting for a response.
 * - `owl` — we are looking, and there is nothing found yet (search).
 * - `party` — a group is celebrating a shared completion.
 * - `robot` — an agent is ready to work, and waiting to be told what to do.
 * - `snail` — something is being read right now, and it is taking a moment.
 * - `sparkles` — the absence is the good outcome; there is nothing left to do.
 * - `wand` — the thing that is missing is one you can make right here.
 *
 * See `assets/animations/PROVENANCE.md` for where they came from and what was

 * C-237 LottieScene — one vector animation, played once, drawn on a worker
 * thread.
 *
 * Every frame is decoded, rasterised, and composited by ThorVG (WASM) inside a
 * Web Worker, against an OffscreenCanvas the main thread transfers once and
 * never touches again. There is no requestAnimationFrame loop here, no timer,
 * and no React render per frame. All scenes share one worker.
 *
 * It never loops. The scene plays once when the state it illustrates appears,
 * and then holds its last frame — which for all eighteen animations is the pose
 * they were drawn to return to, so the held picture is a picture worth holding.
 * After that it only moves when a reader asks: a click or tap, a fresh hover
 * entry, or Enter/Space while it has keyboard focus. A replay is refused while
 * one is already running, so a pointer resting inside cannot turn "again" into
 * a loop.
 *
 * The main thread is not completely silent, and it would be dishonest to say so:
 * the renderer posts one small `frame` and one `render` notification per
 * rendered frame, which its own facade handles in constant time — a property
 * write and a dispatch to an empty listener list, since this component
 * subscribes to neither. That is a bounded message per frame, not rendering
 * work, and it is the one cost of the library that cannot be turned off. Once
 * the single play ends even those stop, which is the difference between this
 * and a loop. See the C-237 blueprint page for what it measures at.
 *
 * The scene stops whenever no one is looking — scrolled out of view, or the
 * window hidden — and resumes where it stopped, because a play that was
 * interrupted has still not been seen. A reader who has asked for reduced
 * motion never sees it move at all: it holds the same final frame, nothing
 * starts it, and it is not offered as a control, because the least surprising
 * reading of "reduce motion" is that this picture does not move.
 *
 * Until the runtime has loaded, and forever if it cannot load, the scene
 * renders nothing and leaves whatever its host drew underneath in place. That
 * is the cross-browser and locked-down-CSP fallback: an empty state that keeps
 * its ordinary glyph is a correct empty state, so nothing here is load-bearing.
