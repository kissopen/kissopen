/**
 * C-273 CommandPaletteResults — the ⌘K palette's body: captioned sections of
 * rows with one highlighted row that Enter commits.
 *
 * It is presentational. The rows, their order, and which one is highlighted
 * come in as props, and the arrow keys are never listened for here: the palette
 * input keeps focus and its owner moves the index, the way the composer drives
 * its command picker. No row ever takes DOM focus from the input.
 *
 * Because focus stays put, selection is carried two ways rather than one: the
 * `data-active` highlight for anyone who can see it, and a polite live region
 * that speaks the row the highlight just landed on for anyone who cannot. This
 * is deliberately not a listbox. A listbox option may not contain interactive
 * descendants, and a control row's whole purpose is to contain a real, working
 * switch — so the rows are ordinary buttons and divs, the hosted controls keep
 * their native roles, states, and tab stops, and the announcement carries what
 * `aria-selected` would have carried.
 *
 * Two kinds of row share one list. A command row is a 44px button — leading
 * glyph or avatar, title, muted second line, optional trailing cap. A control
 * row hosts the very FormRow + Switch/SegmentedControl the settings page
 * renders, at that row's own natural height, so a preference can be changed
 * where it was found instead of being navigated to.
