/**
 * C-250 WelcomeScreen — the first thing a new reader sees: one centred column of
 * big art, a title, a slogan, a row of dots, and the single button that leaves.
 *
 * The deck itself is C-276 WelcomeDeck, which owns the slides, their timing, and
 * the promise that nothing under the reader's pointer moves while it advances.
 * This screen is what that deck is standing in: the window it fills, the scenery
 * behind it, and the one button that leaves.
 *
 * It fills the window of an Electron app that draws no native title bar, so it
 * owns the drag lane across its own top 56px the way every other full-window
 * state does. The lane is an absolutely positioned overlay outside the flex
 * flow: the centred column is laid out as if it were not there, and it stays
 * pinned to the window's top edge rather than scrolling away with the content
 * at the minimum window height.
 *
 * The optional backdrop is also outside that flow: either one full-window
 * decorative WebGL canvas or the appearance-matched still sky, below every
 * control. Both are quietest behind the central copy, so the chosen light or
 * dark appearance remains authoritative.
 *
 * The appearance switcher in the opposite corner is out of that flow for the
 * same reason and one more: it exists on a screen whose whole argument is that
 * nothing moves under the pointer, so it must not be able to take a pixel from
 * the column no matter which of the three glyphs it is showing. It is the
 * bottom-right corner precisely because the drag lane owns the top, and the two
 * can never contend for the same 56px.
 *
 * Props only: the words are the app's, the layout and the timing are ours.
