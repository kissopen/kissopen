 * C-239 HtmlPreviewError — what a preview region says instead of a page.
 *
 * A page that cannot load leaves the embedder's guest blank, or shows the
 * engine's own error document, and neither belongs in Kissopen. This is the one
 * place that turns a host-reported failure into a sentence: a short title, one
 * line of plain explanation, and — only when there is one — the raw engine
 * detail underneath, so a developer looking at a local document still sees
 * exactly what the engine reported.
 *
 * It carries no control. A preview reloads when the file behind it changes and
 * its address is resolved again with it, so a button whose only act is asking
 * for the same load again would be the surface admitting it does not keep
 * itself current.
