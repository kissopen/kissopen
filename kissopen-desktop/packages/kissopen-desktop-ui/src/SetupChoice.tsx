/**
 * C-251 SetupChoice — a fork in setup, drawn as the two ways themselves rather
 * than as a list of them.
 *
 * Two equal columns sit side by side: the animation that stands for a choice,
 * the words that say what it does, and then the button that takes it. The shape
 * is the argument — a stacked list of options reads as a recommendation followed
 * by an alternative, because the eye takes the first row as the answer and the
 * second as the footnote. Two columns on one line are visibly a question with two
 * answers.
 *
 * The clickable thing is the button at the foot of each column, not the column.
 * A whole panel that is secretly a button gives the reader nothing to aim at and
 * no way to read the description without hovering something that will act on
 * them; it also swallows the animation, which then cannot offer its own replay
 * because replaying a picture must never read as choosing the option under it.
 * With a real button the art is just art, the words are just words, and exactly
 * one target does something.
 *
 * The columns are equal width and equal height whatever their words weigh, so the
 * longer description cannot make its side look like the bigger offer, and both
 * buttons land on the same line.
 *
 * `LottieScene` handles motion, reduced motion, and its own replay affordance, so
 * nothing here starts, stops, or times anything. It also renders nothing at all
 * until its worker runtime arrives, and forever in an engine that cannot load
 * one — which is why the title and description carry the whole meaning and the
 * animation only illustrates it. A column with no picture is still a complete
 * choice.
 *
 * Props only: no selected state, no internal choice. Picking is an event; what
 * happens next belongs to the flow that asked the question.
