 *
 * A single bar can only say how far along something is; this says which part of
 * it is happening. That matters when the steps are not interchangeable — someone
 * watching an agent restart cares whether their work is still finishing or the
 * process is already gone, and one continuous bar at 40% answers neither.
 *
 * Every segment is the same width, because the steps are not comparable in
 * duration and pretending otherwise would make the bar a schedule it cannot
 * keep. The bar reports the sequence's shape and which step of it is live; only
 * a step that counts something reports a position inside itself.
 *
 * A live step with nothing in it yet sweeps, whether or not it can count. The
 * bar is watched while it advances on its own, and an empty track holding still
 * is read as one that has died — which is the wrong thing to say at the exact
 * moment the step has only just begun.
 *
 * Props only: which steps exist and where each one stands belong to whatever is
 * running them.
