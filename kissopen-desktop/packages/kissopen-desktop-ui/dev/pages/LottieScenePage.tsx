All rasterising happens off the main thread, which transfers the canvas once and afterwards only sends play, pause, and seek; the renderer posts back one small frame notification per frame while it runs, and none once it rests. It stops when scrolled out of view or the window is hidden, replays on a click, a fresh hover, or Enter/Space, refuses to replay while it is already running, and never loops. Under reduced motion it holds a still frame and is not a control at all."

Disguised face: this machine's identity is being defined. Front-facing baby chick: a new social identity is ready to meet people. Hatching chick: something new was created. Llama: several models are combined on one job. Mirror ball: one session, channel, or moment a whole circle is in at once. Hear-no-evil monkey: nobody outside can listen to this. Open hands: a social invitation awaits a response. Owl: we are looking and nothing is found yet. Party: a group shares a celebration. Robot: an agent is ready and waiting to be told what to do. Snail: something is being read and it is taking a moment. Sparkles: the absence is the good outcome. Wand: the missing thing is one you can make here."
