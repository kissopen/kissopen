         * quarters of the machine, and keep Vitest's own ceiling of 12 per pool: past
         * that the single node process driving all three chokes, which is what the cap
         * in its source is for. Bounding it this way is also strictly faster in wall
         * clock (61.6s against 89.6s), so developers and release validation share one
